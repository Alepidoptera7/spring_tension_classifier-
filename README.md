# Classification for tissue types and cell pathogenicity with spring tension modeling 

In the classifier for tissue type prediction from scRNA data case, GTEx data was used for training and test with inferences represented through spring tension. 

In the classifier for cell pathogenicity and developmental stage case, cellxgene data was used to determine the pathogenicity and disease state of individual cells. Model inferences were again represented with spring tension.
